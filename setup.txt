# LogFlow Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Go 1.20+ installed
- Git

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/serilevanjalines/LogFlow.git
   cd LogFlow

2. Initialize Go modules (if not already done):
   go mod init github.com/serilevanjalines/LogFlow
   go mod tidy

3. Create .env file in root:
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

4. Install dependencies:
   go mod download

## Running

1. Start the server (in one terminal):
   go run ./cmd/server/main.go
   
   Server will listen on :8080

2. Start the agent (in another terminal):
   go run ./cmd/agent/main.go
   
   Agent will read app.log and send to server

3. Test Gemini integration:
   go run test_gemini.go

## Endpoints

- POST /ingest - Receive log events
- GET /logs - Query stored logs (filters: service, level, from, to)


So , the key point it , your sever will listen to /ingest endpoint and your agent will always parse the logs from app.log and sends
them to your /ingest :)
